# Celeste-For-GBA

This project is mainly for me to learn and practice C.  You will find all the source and header files here.  Most of the sprites and mechanics you will see are from the original game.  For clarity's sake, my own work is the following:
- Translating the main character's movement code from C# to C.
- Sprite handling system
- Hair physics
- Designing and implimenting the zip lines found in Chapter 2.
- Tile based physics
- Particle system
- Compiler that translates levels, sprites, background, and dialogue into a GBA friendly format.
